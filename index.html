            Jan Todd is a legendary figure in the world of strength sports and was once known as the <span class="highlight">"strongest woman in the world."</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            In <span class="highlight">1977</span>, she became the first woman to lift over <span class="highlight">1,000 lbs</span> in a three-lift powerlifting meet and went on to set more than 60 national and world records.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond her athletic accomplishments, she has been a tireless advocate for strength history and education. Alongside her husband, Terry Todd, she co-founded the Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports at the University of Texas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her career helped reshape the cultural narrative around female strength—proving that women not only belong in strength sports but can thrive, lead, and inspire.
